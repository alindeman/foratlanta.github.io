      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Launched in January 2013, Focus On Results Atlanta (FOR Atlanta) is the City&rsquo;s performance management team charged with delivering tangible and lasting improvements across City services by collaborating with departments to drive performance improvement. We assess City services and identify opportunities to improve results through data-driven decision-making, business process efficiencies, organizational strategies and technology applications.</p>
        <p>Mayor Kasim Reed has made a commitment to ensuring management excellence and constant improvement in service delivery is a priority for the City of Atlanta. We are operating in an increasingly competitive world while striving to do more with less, and to deliver a better product for our customers. Strategic performance management is critical for driving strong policy and operational decisions, particularly in City government. As we respond to the growing needs of our City and residents, the prioritization of cost, resources and impact is critical for effective management of performance.</p>
        <p>Housed within the Office of the Chief Operating Officer, FOR Atlanta is a structured, iterative program of evaluation and improvement that FOR Atlanta leverages has helped the City:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make measurable progress across Mayor Reed&rsquo;s priorities.</li>
          <li>Focus on outcomes, and their impact on citizens, by identifying and tracking core performance metrics that represent the results the City seeks to drive.</li>
          <li>Use hard data and thoughtful analysis to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of municipal services, further ensuring that City resources and taxpayer dollars are being used as efficiently as possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The highlights included in the 2013 Performance Report include data and case studies demonstrating how performance improvement has helped advance results and accountability across city departments and priority areas during the Mayor&rsquo;s first term. As we enter a new year and a new Administration, FOR Atlanta looks forward to continuing to play a critical role in driving results and helping the Reed Administration move Atlanta forward, together.</p>
