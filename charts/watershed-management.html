The Department’s mission includes delivering excellent customer service and ensuring professional stewardship of Atlanta’s drinking water, waste water and storm water systems.

  <p>This page provides performance data on key indicators related to core areas of the Department’s operations – Customer Service, Billing, Infrastructure Management and Compliance.</p>
  <p>In August 2014, in preparation for the launch of the City's new 311 call center, the Department undertook an extensive review and update of the service level agreements (SLAs) and performance targets for all of the 50+ Service Request types that it handles.  To ensure data quality and comparability across time, the starting point of the Department's Customer Service data on this page will be August 2014.</p>
