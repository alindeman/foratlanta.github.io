    - title: All Customer Service Requests (Total Department)
      summary: This figure shows the total volume of all customer service requests that the Department of Watershed Management (DWM) receives on a monthly basis. [This covers every element of the Department’s operations – from billing queries to leaking hydrant complaints and reports of missing street plates.] It also shows DWM’s performance in fulfilling those requests on time each month.
      description: The graph shows two key trends over the past year - the volume of customer service requests has increased since January 2014, while DWM’s performance has decreased over the same period. The cause of this performance is manifold, including staffing challenges and challenges arising from a recent upgrade to the Department’s IT system. <p>In any given month, the "Total Number of Service Requests" is defined as the sum of the number of Service Requests closed during the month and the number of Service Requests open as of the end of the month.  Volume is calculated this way to ensure that open Service Requests continue to count towards performance until they are closed.</p>

      summary: This figure measures the number of new customer account requests that DWM receives each month. It also measures the Department’s responsiveness in activating those accounts within 24 hours of the request being made.
      description: The results show that DWM has consistently activated nearly 100 percent of new accounts on time in every month. The volume of customer requests for new accounts has fluctuated between 600 and 1000 per month. The total number of active customer accounts is around 150,000.

    - title: Meter Investigation Service Requests
      summary: This figure measures the number of meter investigations carried out by DWM each month, and the Department’s performance in carrying out those investigations in a timely manner. Customers can request a meter investigation where they believe there is something wrong with their meter that is causing it to give false readings about the amount of water they are consuming. DWM’s target is to complete a meter investigation within 7 business days of the customer making the request.
      description: This metric has only been tracked since February 2014. The results to date show a slight downward trend in the percent of all customer service requests within 7 business days. Meter investigations deal with a very small fraction of the more-than 150,000 meters that are installed across the city.

    - title: Street Flooding Inspection Service Requests
      summary: This figure measures DWM’s responsiveness to customer service calls about water pooling in city streets. Because this pooling can be a symptom of several different problems, the first course of action is always for Watershed staff to inspect the site and determine the root cause of the problem. DWM has a goal of responding to all such customer calls and initiating an inspection within 4 hours.
      description: The Department has steadily improved its performance from January to September 2014. This can be attributed to both operational improvements within the Department as well as a decreasing volume of Service Requests.

      summary: This figure reports the number of customer complaints received by DWM about the quality of its drinking water. The Department’s target is to resolve each complaint within 8 hours of it being reported.
      description: As the graph shows, DWM’s performance has improved since January. While performance is bumpy, there is an overall upward trend. The overall number of complaints received – a max of 200 complaints in August – represents less than 0.1% of all customers.

  charts:
    - title: Estimated Bills as a Percent of Bills Issued
      summary: The Department has made a big effort over recent years to move away from estimating monthly bills and instead provide accurate bills based on actual water consumption. This metric tracks the Department’s progress in moving all customers away from estimated bills.
      description: The figure shows the great progress that the Department has made in recent years. From 10% in May 2009, monthly results are now consistently below 1% and DWM is on track to meet its target of only 0.5% of customer bills being estimated.

    - title: Water System Breaks and Sewage Spills
      summary: This figure tracks the condition of Atlanta’s the water distribution system by measuring the number of water breaks per 100 miles of pipe and sewage spills per 100 mils of sewer.  These metrics are good indicators of the health of the City's overall water system infrastructure.
      description: The results show the number of breaks trending down over the period until October 2012. Following a six month period of increasing breaks, the number is again trending down to around 13. This indicates approximately one break for every 10 miles of Atlanta’s distribution system piping each year.  Since the start of 2014, sewage spills have decreased and held consistently between 7-8 spills per 100 milles of sewer.

      summary: These measures track DWM’s performance in complying with relevant drinking water and waste water quality regulations. Both measures show how many days out of the last year that the Department has been in compliance with federal, state and local regulations.
      description: The figure shows that the Department has been in compliance with all relevant regulations close to 100% of the time. Waste water temporarily dipped below its target of 98% during 2013, but that has since been remedied. Drinking water has consistently met all regulations and requirements since FOR Atlanta began tracking performance in January 2013.
