    - title: All Customer Service Requests (Total Department)
      summary: This figure shows the total volume of all customer service requests that the Department of Watershed Management (DWM) receives on a monthly basis. [This covers every element of the department’s operations – from billing queries to leaking hydrant complaints and reports of missing street plates.] It also shows DWM’s performance in fulfilling those requests on time each month.
      description: -	The graph shows two key trends over the past year - the volume of customer service requests has increased since January 2014, while DWM’s performance has decreased over the same period. This is partly the result of a recent upgrade to the department’s IT system. We expect the red performance line to begin trending back up from May 2014 onwards.
