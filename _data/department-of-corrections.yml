    - title: Detention Center Population
      summary: The City of Atlanta Detention Center houses persons arrested on city ordinance charges and those sentenced by judges in certain criminal trials. Detention Center populations are measured at least 3 times a day and the average of all daily counts shows the estimated Detention Center population at any given time during the month (blue). The number of inmates booked (red) and released (blue) includes inmates that stay in the municipal Detention Center for any amount of time. This includes pre-trial inmates arrested, but not yet sentenced.
      description: Average daily Detention Center population for fiscal year 2014 was above the fiscal year 2013 population by 25%. Much of this extra population is driven by housing inmates temporarily from federal agencies, which also helps maximize space and offset costs.
